This code is associated with our publication "Analytical Solutions to Three-Dimensional Reactive Contaminant Transport Problems Involving Point, Line, and Area Sources". You can access the paper from DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11242-022-01828-x

Use driver3DContaminantTransport.m to run the model. Use the variable sourceType to switch between Point, Line and Area source and use Option.sourceBoundary to change the boundary conditions. The default source characteristics are set according to our publication, you can change these by accessing the input matlab files available in the Input folders. For detailed description of the variables used please refer to out paper.
